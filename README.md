# rebac

ReBACâ€™s role derivation allows us to construct authorization policies that are far more efficient for hierarchies than RBAC. In RBAC, we would have to assign users roles that grant them direct access to each folder and file. ReBAC allows us to avoid that by leveraging existing application-level relationships and creating simple policies based on hierarchies and groupings.
